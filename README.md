# InstagramEmbed (vxinstagram)

**InstagramEmbed** is a lightweight Instagram link embedding tool designed for Discord and other platforms supporting the [Open Graph Protocol (OGP)](https://ogp.me/). It offers full support for embedding Instagram photos and videos, enabling seamless previews across chats, forums, and websites.

Unlike traditional solutions that rely on limited scraping techniques, InstagramEmbed leverages the [Snapsave Media Downloader](https://github.com/ahmedrangel/snapsave-media-downloader) for robust and consistent content retrieval—ensuring compatibility with the majority of public Instagram media.

## Features

- Embed Instagram **photos** and **videos** anywhere OGP is supported
- Powered by the reliable SnapSave API
- Fast response

## How It Works

1. User pastes an Instagram link with "vx" at the beginning (vxinstagram) (e.g., into Discord).
2. The page generates a preview with embedded media using Open Graph tags.
3. The platform (e.g., Discord) renders the embed automatically.
