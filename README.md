# InstagramEmbed (vxinstagram)

**InstagramEmbed** is a lightweight Instagram link embedding tool designed for Discord and other platforms supporting the [Open Graph Protocol (OGP)](https://ogp.me/). It offers full support for embedding Instagram photos and videos, enabling seamless previews across chats, forums, and websites.

## How It Works

1. User pastes an Instagram link with "vx" at the beginning (vxinstagram) (e.g., into Discord).
2. The page generates a preview with embedded media using Open Graph tags.
3. The platform (e.g., Discord) renders the embed automatically.

## API Integration

InstagramEmbed uses this backend API for fetching Instagram content:
